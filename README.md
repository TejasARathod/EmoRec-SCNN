# EmoRec-SCNN

Research project on Emotion Recognition using Siamese Networks across 5 datasets to validate the findings of submitted paper. The work is open for replication or modification under the condition that proper credit is given to the author. Feel free to explore, replicate, or build upon this research to contribute to the field of emotion recognition.


## Repository Overview

In the 'Code Files' folder, you will find Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the five datasets used for evaluating the SCNN (Siamese Convolutional Neural Network) architecture. Each dataset has three folders:

- CNN: This folder contains the code files for basic CNN architecture used for comparisons with the SCNN multi-emotion model.
- SCNN-SE: Here, you will find the code for SCNN single-emotion models that were trained for each specific emotion.
- SCNN-ME: This folder contains the code for single-emotion models that were tested together.
- Additionally, there is a 'Statistics' folder that contains Excel sheets used for conducting analysis and presenting the results in the research paper.
